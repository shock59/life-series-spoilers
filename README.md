  Often the members of the Life Series will include major spoilers for the episodes in the title and thumbnail (such as "[Last Life episode 7: The Last Life Of Scar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29vAW4df3Ic)", "[I'M THE FIRST PLAYER ELIMINATED!! | Last Life | #7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv8fOuLU44U)", and [No More Bad Boys :( | Limited Life Ep.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4zs5_HRXtQ&t=3s&pp=ygUNc21hbGxpc2hiZWFucw%3D%3D)). This can ruin the viewing experience because you already know what happens, so this extension helps to keep the surprise in the episodes.
